# [\[Archer-Base\] \[F\] Vanilla FE6 Alt1](./)
## Credits

Animation by IS.

Note that this animation is extremely similar to the other FE6 IS Female Archer animation in the Repo. The only difference seems to be a slightly adjust attack/crit timing. If there are any palette differences, I can't tell.
