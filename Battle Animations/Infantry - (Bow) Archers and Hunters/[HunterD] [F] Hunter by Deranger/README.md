# [\[HunterD\] \[F\] Hunter by Deranger](./)
## Credits

Made by Deranger.

Female variant by Jey the Count.

Note that Deranger's hunters are among the oldest in the community, and as such, could use some touchups. MeatOfJustice made a revamped Hunter, but a simple set of timing/frame fixes for the original Ranger does not yet exist.
