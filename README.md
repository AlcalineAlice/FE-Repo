# Fire-Emblem-Graphics-Repository

This is a public free to use and (sometimes) free to edit repository of graphics for Fire Emblem romhacking, Tactile Game creation, and Lex Talionis game creation. There are probably other Fire Emblem game creation tools that can use the resources in this repository, too.

This repository contains: Portraits, battle animations, map sprites, music files, and countless other assorted resources people might like to use.

All battle animations are F2E. Many other resources are F2E, but some are only F2U. Not sure what that means? Check this thread for more info:

If you go inside any specific animation's folder, you will also find credits for that animation.
