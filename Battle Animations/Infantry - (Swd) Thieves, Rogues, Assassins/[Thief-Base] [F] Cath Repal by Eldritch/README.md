Repalette by Eldritch Abomination.

Note that I am not certain if the Unarmed animation shares the same palette as the Sword version. However, since thieves do not typically show their weapons, an Unarmed animation is not strictly necessary, and thus I will leave it to the community to fix this if they want.

## Weapons
