## Credits

There are two animations in this folder, both based off the FE10 Soldier still-image by Jeorge Reds.

Flasuban made the base version of the FE10 Soldier, animating it from Jeorge Red's still.

Nuramon then made two new revisions, namely the Fast/Straight and Slow/Angled versions.

Slow/Angled is the first version Nuramon made.

Fast/Straight is a revision based off the vanilla GBA Soldier movements, made to look more like the GBA timings.
