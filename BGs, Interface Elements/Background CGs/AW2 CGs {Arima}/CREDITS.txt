- {Arima} for ripping them.

If you clicked here you earned some fun facts.

CG 1 - This CG shows some Tiger tanks being produced in a factory, they are never seen in game.

CG 2 - This CG shows what looks like a Leopard,KV-1 and ARL-44 Tank in a battle, KV-1 has no mobility capabilities to run
and we never see this vehicles in game.

CG 3 - A Laboratory with what looks like a jaguar very close to the image.

CG 4 - The big factories used by Black Hole.

CG 5 - A figher that hit another one, the fighter looks like a F-15C.

is likely they are from Orange Star.

CG 8 - A tank that looks like a M3 Stuart from WW2.

CG 9 - A river.

CG 13 - A japanese tank, looks like a Type 97 Chi-Ha.

CG 14 - A Matilda II Tank.

CG 15 - Sonja with a dog.

CG 16 - An island full of black hole cannons, it's very likely to be the island where Green Earth goes throught the campaign.

CG 17 - A volcano with two tanks, I have no idea what tanks these are.

CG 18 - A german Sturmtiger tank facing black hole cannons. It could be a Jagdpanther but the small and big cannon makes
me believe it's a Sturmtiger tank.

CG 19 - The special Black cannon used by the black hole in campaign mode.

CG 20 - A M4 Sherman tank with some orange star soldiers.

CG 21 - Some Yellow Comet hellicopters, I have no idea what copters these are.

CG 22 - A submarine from Orange Star, in real life a lot of submarines look like the same so the subs that looks like the one
from the CG are the USS Wisconsin (SSBN-827) and USS Columbia (SSBN-826).

CG 23 - Nell, Sonja, Sami and Jess.

CG 24 - An M1A2 Abrams tank, this image can be seen when you start your game.

CG 25 - An image from the end of the game, we can see the Mega Tank, however this tank is never seen in game and only was
added in the next game Advance Wars Dual Strike. 
The color is also blue showing that Blue Moon created it and it's its owner.
